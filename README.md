A PHP-based webapp for revision cards. UI is currently limited and connects to a LOCAL databse (connected). Involves flip cards, and stores data in the database (requires knowledge of mySQL to set up).

Despite working as a locally-hosted site for revision cards, this is more of a proof-of-concept as practice for PHP and MySQL Databases. 

All code is commented, and should be understandable.

Future Functionality is not planned as of yet, although possibilities include filtering revision cards per subject, creating a dynamic website to host this on properly, etcetera.

However, at the moment I don't have the resources for this, so to set this up and use developer knowledge is necessary. The style of the PHP table is included: however certain edits may have to be made depending on how it is hosted. Style is also currently limited.

Due to this, the project has not been containerized, nor have links to the database (being locally hosted) been made secure. It may also be planned in the future to do this, using built-in-functions such as 'filtervar' at a low level. 

### Using
As mentioned, this does require knowledge of PHP. To use, download all files and setup the PHP server. Make any edits necessary.
